# Linked Data Project
Semantic Web Linked Data Project. Lecturer: Ian McLoughlin

In the case of the AIB Datathon datasets/project being unsuitable for this project the following is my backup proposal:

## Datasets

I intend to use the following two data sets, sourced from data.gov.ie:

http://www.hea.ie/sites/default/files/awards_-_all_undergraduate_by_level_and_field.xlsx

http://www.hea.ie/sites/default/files/awards_-_all_postgraduate_by_level_and_field.xlsx

These datasets contain the breakdown of graduates from each college, school and field of study and gender at an undergraduate and postgraduate level respectively.

### Proposal

I intend to create the API to allow users to probe popularity of courses and percentage of progression from undergraduate to postgraduate in a given field. It should also return the gender break down by field of study or Institute of Higher Leanring.

### Stretch

These data sets are for the 2014-2015 graduation period, there are similar datasets for previous years, so I may add in one or two of these to allow periodic comparison and also add API methods to allow insertion of new data.
